## v1.2.0
This is a MINOR upgrade as performance has been reduced due to increased scope.

- Allow a constraint element to be set which stops the sticky element from appearing outside of the constraint by setting a relative top position as soon as it does.

## v1.1.1
- Reset inline width on sticky element if it gets set.
- Improve performance by ensuring `getWidthFrom` option is only calculated when it's passed when initialised.

## v1.1.0
- Added `bower.json`.
- Stopped `defaults` being overwritten.

## v1.0.0
Forked from garand/sticky
